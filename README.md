# Teufelland_game
a simple console rpg game for windows made for a school project made with c++ and python
i've attached a zip file to the rep with game, levels, python scripts and sources. Unpacking zip file is needed to
run Teufelland game.exe. Before running, make sure that python and PATH for python is installed on the computer.

use W, A, S, D to move around, M to open menu, where you can see character's characteristics, head over to 
shopping menu or crafting menu. '#' symbol is wall, 'O' - enemy (just go to his tile to start fight),
'?' - treasure with random loot, '!' - trap. On the last level there are specific symbols on the map ('A' and 'B')
which activate cutscenes or boss fight. Combat is turn-based. Each enemy has it's own value, which depends on
the level player is in. On that value depends enemy's HP and attack. Player's armor can compensate some damage.
To buy new weaponary or armor, head over to menu. There you can go to shopping menu to buy new staff, or to the
crafting menu to craft staff from details. Details and money are looted from defeated enemies. To change level
head over to right edge of the map.
